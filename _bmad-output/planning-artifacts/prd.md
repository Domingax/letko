# Product Requirements Document - Lekto

**Author:** Damien
**Date:** 2026-03-07

## Executive Summary

**Lekto** is an open-source immersive language learning application for Web and Android. It replicates the reading experience of LingQ — content import, vocabulary highlighting by mastery level, integrated contextual lookup, and vocabulary management — on a fully local architecture: no server required, no subscription, user data stays on the device.

The product targets two user profiles: **technical users** (developers, power users) who want to read in their target language, own their data, and optionally connect their own AI services; and **general learners** who want an "open and read" experience that is free, simple, and works out of the box.

The problem being solved is concrete friction: mandatory internet connection to read, data stored on a third-party server without simple export, and a monthly subscription required for a complete experience. Lekto removes these frictions one by one without sacrificing reading experience quality.

### What Makes This Special

**End-to-end fluency is the product.** Not a single feature — the coherence of the entire journey: import an EPUB or PDF → text displayed with words color-coded by mastery level → click a word or phrase → dictionary or AI translation without leaving the page → word saved with context. Every step is immediate, local, and uninterrupted.

**Open source as contribution, not strategy.** No business model to defend. The codebase is readable, forkable, and contributor-friendly. Community adoption is a secondary success; the primary success is personal.

**BYOK AI as product philosophy.** AI is not an opaque service provided by the app — it is a service the user connects from their own subscriptions (OpenAI, Anthropic, Copilot, Ollama...). Applications should consume the user's AI, not the reverse. The app is fully functional without AI; AI is a progressive enhancement.

## Project Classification

| Dimension | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Project Type** | Hybrid Web + Mobile App (Capacitor — React/Vite/TypeScript) |
| **Domain** | EdTech / Consumer Language Learning |
| **Complexity** | Low-medium — no regulatory constraints, personal open-source project |
| **Project Context** | Greenfield — new application, no existing codebase |

## Success Criteria

### User Success

Lekto is successful when the author uses it as their primary daily reading tool without feeling limited compared to LingQ. The bar is functional parity for the core reading loop, not feature parity across the board.

Key success moments:
- **Reading flow**: A full chapter completed without the lookup panel breaking concentration — word and phrase translation feels instant and contextual.
- **Cross-device continuity**: A session started on Android (pages read, words saved) is seamlessly resumable on the web app — same reading position, same updated vocabulary list.
- **Habit formation**: The app is opened for reading sessions as consistently as LingQ would be, without friction creating a reason to switch back.

### Business Success

No commercial objectives. Success is personal: the author completes reading sessions in Lekto without reverting to LingQ.

Secondary success (not a requirement): the project is useful to others. 10 satisfied users would already be a positive outcome.

### Technical Success

- **Documentation as a first-class deliverable**: README, architecture documentation, and how-it-works guides complete, accurate, and maintained throughout development. A new contributor can understand the project and run it locally from the README alone.
- **Clean, testable codebase**: Unit and E2E tests implemented; no merge without a green CI pipeline (lint → test → build).
- **BMAD validation**: The project validates that BMAD agents can develop independent features concurrently without conflicts, following defined architecture and conventions.

### Measurable Outcomes

| Outcome | Definition of Done |
|---------|-------------------|
| Full reading session | Import → read → save words end-to-end without switching to LingQ |
| Cross-device sync | Read on Android, resume on web at same position with same vocabulary |
| New device restore | Point app to existing vault → full reading history and vocabulary restored |
| Contributor-ready | New contributor runs the project locally following README in under 10 minutes |

## User Journeys

### Journey 1 — First Use

A user hears about Lekto on a forum and opens the web app. No account prompt, no paywall — the app loads directly into an empty library. A vault folder is automatically created in a standard local location so the user can start immediately.

A non-intrusive prompt appears: *"Your reading data is stored in a local vault. Want to sync across devices? Point your vault to a cloud-synced folder."* The user can dismiss it and read now, or immediately redirect the vault to their Google Drive or Syncthing folder — their choice, no pressure.

They tap "Import" and pick an EPUB from their device. A brief import animation, and the book appears in the library. They open it — the text is there, words color-coded by mastery level.

They tap on an unfamiliar word. A panel slides up instantly, showing dictionary entries from WordReference and Google Translate — still inside the app, no tab switch. They read the translation, understand the word in context, and tap "Save". The word is now in their vocabulary list with the sentence it came from.

They close the app. *This felt fast. This felt right.*

**Capabilities revealed:** vault auto-creation with optional relocation, file import flow, EPUB parsing and tokenization, mastery-level word coloring, translation panel (dictionary), in-app dictionary display, vocabulary save with context.

---

### Journey 2 — Daily Reading Session

Three days later, the same user opens the app on their Android phone during their commute. The library shows the book they started, with a progress bar and "Resume at Chapter 3". They tap it — the reader opens exactly where they left off.

They read for 15 minutes, clicking on a handful of words, saving two of them. They reach their stop and close the app.

That evening, they open Lekto on their laptop browser. The library reflects the same progress. The two words saved on the phone are in their vocabulary list. They continue reading from Chapter 3, page 12 — exactly where the phone left off.

**Capabilities revealed:** reading position persistence, cross-device sync via vault, vocabulary sync, library resume indicator, platform consistency (web + Android).

---

### Journey 3 — AI Discovery and Setup

A few sessions in, the user selects a multi-word phrase they don't understand. The translation panel opens, but instead of a full phrase translation, it shows: *"Connect your AI to translate phrases and sentences."* A small "Set up" link sits below the message — unobtrusive, never blocking.

Curious, they tap it. A settings screen explains in plain language: *"Lekto can use your own AI subscription to translate phrases. Your key is stored securely on this device only and never shared."* Three providers are listed: OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama. They pick OpenAI, paste their API key into a masked field, and tap Save.

They return to their book, select the same phrase. This time, a fluid translation appears — contextual, accurate, in their native language. They save the phrase with the translation.

**Capabilities revealed:** progressive disclosure of AI features, BYOK API key setup flow, secure key storage, provider selection, phrase-level AI translation, graceful fallback when AI is not configured.

---

### Journey 4 — OSS Contributor

A developer learning Japanese discovers Lekto on GitHub. The README is clear: what the project does, why it exists, how to run it locally. They clone the repo, run `npm install && npm run dev`, and the app opens in their browser in under 5 minutes.

They browse the architecture documentation and understand the import pipeline: EPUB → tokenizer → SQLite. They want to add support for a new dictionary provider for Japanese (Jisho). The contributing guide points them to the relevant module. The code is structured, typed, and tested — they can follow the pattern of an existing provider.

They open a PR. The CI pipeline runs automatically — lint, tests, build all pass. A maintainer reviews and merges within the week.

**Capabilities revealed:** contributor documentation (README, architecture, contributing guide), local dev setup, modular dictionary provider system by language pair, CI pipeline on PRs.

## Innovation & Novel Patterns

### Detected Innovation Areas

**BYOK AI in Language Learning**

The BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) movement — users connecting their own AI subscriptions to third-party applications — is an emerging pattern with an active community, but it has no significant presence in the language learning space. Lekto does not invent this approach; it applies it to a domain where it is currently absent.

Proprietary language learning tools are moving in the opposite direction, bundling AI as a premium paid feature within their subscription tiers. Lekto's BYOK model is structurally incompatible with a subscription business, making it unlikely that commercial competitors will adopt it — creating durable differentiation.

**Local-First Vault Architecture in an Immersive Reader**

The vault model — user-owned, portable, sync-agnostic data storage — is well-established in the note-taking space (Obsidian, Logseq) but absent from immersive language learning tools. The reason is architectural as much as business: community features (shared content libraries, collaborative vocabulary, user-generated lessons) are a core value driver in commercial language learning tools and inherently require cloud infrastructure, creating a virtuous cycle — community → cloud → subscription. Note-taking tools lack this community imperative, which is why local-first has succeeded there.

Lekto's deliberate exclusion of community features is not only a scope decision — it is what makes local-first architecture coherent and sustainable.

### Market Context

- Language learning tools (LingQ, Readlang, Clozemaster) are uniformly cloud-first and subscription-based
- Community features require cloud infrastructure and reinforce the cloud-first model in this space
- Note-taking tools have validated the vault/local-first model at scale (Obsidian, Logseq) precisely because note-taking is a personal, non-community activity
- BYOK AI is an established pattern in developer and productivity tools, not yet present in language learning
- The language learning tool market is smaller than note-taking, limiting community growth potential — but also meaning less competition for a local-first alternative

### Validation Approach

- **BYOK AI value**: validated by the author's own daily use — consistent use of AI translation over dictionary links confirms its value.
- **Vault sync reliability**: validated by the cross-device sync success criterion (read on Android, resume on web).

## Web + Mobile App Specific Requirements

### Architecture Overview

Lekto is a hybrid web + mobile application built with Capacitor (React/Vite/TypeScript). The web app is the primary development target; the Android app is the same codebase wrapped in a native container. Both platforms share the same local-first architecture and vault-based storage model.

### Platform Support

| Platform | Target | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Web — Chrome / Edge | Full support | File System Access API + OPFS fully supported |
| Web — Firefox | Full support | OPFS fallback (no `showDirectoryPicker`); vault accessible via OPFS sandbox |
| Web — Safari | Partial | OPFS supported (Safari 16.4+); `showDirectoryPicker` unavailable — vault sandboxed, manual import/export for sync |
| Android | Full support | Capacitor wrapper; Android 11+ required |
| iOS | Post-MVP (v4) | Architecturally compatible with Capacitor; deferred |

### Offline Mode

The application is **fully offline by design**. Network access is used only for:
- Dictionary lookups — opened in-app browser; degrade gracefully if offline
- BYOK AI translation — silently unavailable if offline
- Vault sync — handled entirely by the user's chosen third-party service

### Device Features (Android)

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| File system access | `@capacitor/filesystem` + file picker for vault folder selection |
| Secure storage (API keys) | `@aparajita/capacitor-secure-storage` — Android Keystore backed |
| TTS audio | `@capacitor-community/text-to-speech` — Android TTS engine |
| File import (EPUB/PDF) | `@capawesome-team/capacitor-file-picker` |

### Distribution

| Channel | Timeline |
|---------|----------|
| Web — self-hosted / static | MVP |
| Android — GitHub Releases (APK) | MVP |
| Android — F-Droid | MVP |
| Android — Google Play Store | Post-MVP |
| iOS — App Store | v4 |

### Implementation Constraints

- **Single codebase**: all platform differences handled via Capacitor plugins and platform detection — no platform-specific branches in business logic
- **Progressive enhancement**: web features (File System Access API) enhanced where available; OPFS fallback where not
- **No SSR / SEO**: SPA only — not a public content site
- **No real-time requirements**: no WebSockets, no server push — all data is local

## Product Scope & Roadmap

### MVP Strategy

**Approach:** Personal Utility MVP — the product is done when it replaces LingQ as the author's daily reading tool without friction or compromise on the core experience. No market validation objective, no investor milestone, no revenue target.

**Resource profile:** Solo developer with AI agent assistance (BMAD workflow). Scope must remain lean enough for one person to ship.

**MVP gate criterion:** Every feature must pass — "without this, does the core reading loop fail?" If no, it is post-MVP.

### MVP Feature Set

| # | Feature | Notes |
|---|---------|-------|
| 1 | **Book import** | EPUB, PDF (word-by-word overlay), plain text |
| 2 | **Library with resume** | Shows imported books with progress; opens at last reading position |
| 3 | **Immersive reader** | Text color-coded by word mastery level; reading customization (font, size, theme, swipe) |
| 4 | **Translation panel** | Word/phrase selection → dictionary services (WordReference, Reverso, Google Translate, Linguee) in-app |
| 5 | **BYOK AI translation** | Phrase translation via user's own LLM; gracefully absent if not configured |
| 6 | **TTS audio** | Pronunciation playback — Web Speech API (web), Android TTS (Android) |
| 7 | **Vocabulary management** | Save word/phrase with translation, notes, confidence level (1→4 + known) |
| 8 | **Vault-based sync** | Portable folder structure; multi-device sync via user's chosen third-party service |
| 9 | **Platforms** | Web (browser) + Android |
| 10 | **Accessibility** | WCAG 2.1 AA (web), TalkBack (Android) — first-class, not post-MVP |

### Out of Scope for MVP

- Phrase/expression highlighting in reader (multi-word vocabulary coloring)
- Spaced repetition review
- Learning statistics / progress dashboard
- iOS
- Audio/podcast support
- Google Play Store publication
- Community features

### Post-MVP Roadmap

| Phase | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **Post-MVP** | Google Play Store publication |
| **v2** | Phrase/expression highlighting in reader — saved multi-word vocabulary entries appear as colored spans in the reader, matching their mastery level (deferred: N-gram matching complexity, cross-layer render impact, performance at scale) |
| **v3** | Spaced repetition review (Anki-like) + learning progress statistics |
| **v4** | Audio — podcast/audio with synchronized transcript (user-provided, BYOK STT via Whisper API, or RSS-embedded) |
| **v5** | iOS support |

### Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **PDF word extraction complexity** | High | PDF.js text content layer + transparent word-level span overlay using extracted character positions. CJK PDF support deferred to post-MVP. |
| **Android file system restrictions (Android 11+)** | Medium | System file picker for vault folder selection; persist access via content:// URIs. Default vault to app Documents directory with optional relocation. |
| **Solo developer scope creep** | High | Strict MVP gate criterion applied to every feature decision. |
| **Vault sync conflicts** | Medium | Out of scope — delegated to user's sync service. Lekto must not corrupt vault data; document this limitation clearly. |
