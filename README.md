# letko

An open-source immersive language learning app for Web and Android. Replicates the LingQ reading experience on a fully local architecture — no server, no subscription, data stays on your device.

Import an EPUB or PDF → words color-coded by mastery level → click to translate → vocabulary saved with context. Every step is local and uninterrupted.

BYOK AI: connect your own OpenAI, Anthropic, or Ollama account. The app is fully functional without AI; AI is a progressive enhancement.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev           # Start Vite dev server
npm run build         # Type-check + production build
npm run typecheck     # TypeScript strict check
npm run lint          # ESLint (zero warnings enforced)
npm run test          # Run test suite
npm run test:coverage # Coverage report
```

## Project Structure

Follows [Feature-Sliced Design](https://feature-sliced.design/) (FSD):

```
src/
├── app/          # Routing, providers, global CSS
├── pages/        # Page-level components
├── widgets/      # Composite UI blocks
├── features/     # User interactions
├── entities/     # Domain models (Book, Word, VocabEntry…)
└── shared/
    ├── ui/       # shadcn/ui components (re-exported)
    ├── db/       # Drizzle schema + migrations
    ├── platform/ # Capacitor adapters
    ├── stores/   # Zustand stores
    └── lib/      # Utils, types, constants
```

Import direction is strictly unidirectional: `pages → widgets → features → entities → shared`.

## Commits

Uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) enforced by commitlint + husky.

```bash
git cz   # Interactive commit via commitizen
```

## Android

Requires Android Studio + Java 17 + `ANDROID_HOME` set.
